# SVT-ROBOTICS-Assesment
Take Home Assesment for Interns
I personally really enjoyed the assessment!! I wish homeworks from school would be this fun too :) 
It was challenging but at the same time I felt that I was solving a real life issue which was amazing! 
Note: In the assesment it didn't say if I need to POST the final json data that's why I left it there but I can also share the version with posting the data through HTTP requests.
